Most chemistry and materials science happens in a three dimensional world. Sometimes materials have too many dimensions (is that how time crystals work?) [1]. More importantly, though, there's room at the bottom. Not just quantum dots or nanotubes, but structures that have a real length and width, but are only a few atoms thick. This blog is about the exciting developments at that frontier!

Ever since the serendipitous isolation of graphene, there have been a wide range of proposed applications, few of which are fully realized [2]. But while graphene is still getting itself organized, still other materials are being discovered and considered, from the straightforward carbon nitride (it's graphene plus nitrogen) to stanene, or planar tin (I didn't think tin could do that!) and each one of those has different properties. And the methods for preparing them have come a long way, too! The original work with graphene was just peeling layers off with adhesive. CVD is common now, but there's a range of conditions for that [3]. And event a few wet chemical techniques [4]!
Seems like a fun area to watch in the coming years. So that's what this is. Two dimensional materials -  at planar.science
